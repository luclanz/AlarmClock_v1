# Firmware Description

    [I'll post a somewhat detailed explanation once all the basic stuff will run fine]


# missing features (for v1.0):
    * speaker and sd module connection - DONE
    * trigger for alarm / timer runout
    * interrupt management system (I need 3 in total)
    * timer countdown in the display

# I had to remake the firmware because I run out of dynamic memory.

# 1 I2C for the DS3231, 2 SPI for the SD module and the LCD screen
