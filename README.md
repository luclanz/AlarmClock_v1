# AlarmClock_v1

I'm trying to create a portable clock with some spare modules and an arduino. Here are its basic specs:

  * Portable
  * Long lasting 12V battery (6/12 months) with led indicator when low
  * Set alarms
  * Set timers
  * Small audio amplifier to reproduce "Daybreak" by M. Haggins as alarm

This is my first relevant project, my aim is just to experience all the steps that comes in the making of a (basic) electronic product, from concept to consumer. I'm not a skilled engineer so I reckon it will take time since I need to learn and improve a lot.

Feel free to use, change or improve any of my design.

# Project roadmap:

  1. Scope definition / Hardware selection
  2. Firmware / Breadboard prototyping        <<< HERE
  3. PCB design
  4. CAD modelling
