# AlarmClock_v1

I'm trying to create a portable clock with some spare modules and an arduino. Here are its basic specs:

  * Portable
  * Long lasting 12V battery (6/12 months) w/ led indicator when low
  * Set alarms
  * Set timers
  * Small audio amplifier to reproduce "Daybreak" by M. Haggins on command

This is my first relevant project, my aim is to learn many tools such as Git, project management techniques, Fusion360 and (possibly) PCB layout. Eventually I'll learn the best practices there are for programming.

Feel free to use, change or improve any of my design.
